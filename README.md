## Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

This is a time series forecasting project. We'll predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.  We are provided with 6 csv files (train, test, store, oil, holidays_events, transactions) containing data about products, stores, promotions, sales, oil prices, holidays and more. Our target: sales.


# Objective.

Specifically, we are to build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores

In evaluating our model, we will determine the RMSLE, RMSE and MSE.


# Research questions

1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?

2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?

3. Did the earthquake impact sales?

4. Are certain groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)

5. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?

6. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?

7. What is the RMSLE, RMSE, MSLE, MSE from the ML model?

# Forecasting-time-series-for-store-sales
This is a time series forecasting project. We'll predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.  We are provided with 6 csv files (train, test, store, oil, holidays_events, transactions) containing data about products, stores, promotions, sales, oil prices, holidays and more. Our target: sales.
